# **eZadb**
*eZadb* is a python application that aims to provide the **Android Debug Bridge** (adb) funcionalities in more simple and intuitive way.

ezadb has two modes:

- **command-line**: this mode allows you to use some of the most common adb commands, e.g.: install/uninstall packages; grant/revoke permissions; input text; etc.
- **graphical mode**: this mode provides almost the same features as the command-line mode but in a more intuitive way.
