**eZadb**
=========

*eZadb* is a python application that aims to provide the **Android Debug
Bridge** (adb) funcionalities in more simple and intuitive way.

ezadb has two modes:

-  **command-line**: this mode allows you to use some of the most common
   adb commands, e.g.: install/uninstall packages; grant/revoke
   permissions; input text; etc.
-  **graphical mode**: this mode provides almost the same features as
   the command-line mode but in a more intuitive way.

To install go to the command line and type:

.. code:: python

     pip install ezadb
